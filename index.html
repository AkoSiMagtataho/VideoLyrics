  <p> <h1>"Cold Water"</h1> is a song by American electronic dance music production group Major Lazer, featuring vocals from Canadian singer Justin Bieber and Danish singer MØ. The song was released on July 22, 2016, as the lead single from their debut greatest hits album, Major Lazer Essentials. It became Major Lazer's third collaboration with MØ after "Lean On" and "Lost". </p>
 <p>Cold Water peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart and number two on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song also reached number one in Australia, Austria, Belgium (Wallonia), Brazil, Canada, Finland, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and Switzerland; as well as the top 10 in Belgium (Flanders), Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Israel, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Mexico, Scotland, South Africa and Spain </p>
  <p> The day before Diplo arrived in New York City in May 2016, he was "more than a little surprised" when Justin Bieber sent a message on Twitter about the track, "Cold Water", asking when it would be coming out. "That was not planned at all," Diplo said. According to Diplo, the song wasn't really done, when Bieber already expressed his excitement. "It's actually very real. Twitter is the only reason I know he's excited about the song. I don't have his number, so he Twitters at me," Diplo added.[3] On May 30, Diplo announced Major Lazer's collaboration with Bieber and MØ. At the time, he did not give a specific release date, only mentioning it would be released "in a couple of weeks" and that it would premiere through Beats</p>

 <h2>Song Lyrics</h2>

        <ul> 
   <li>[Verse 1: Justin Bieber] </br>
Everybody gets high sometimes, you know </br>
What else can we do when we're feelin' low? </br>
So take a deep breath and let it go
 </br>
You shouldn't be drowning on your own
 
</li>

            <li>And if you feel you're sinking </br>
I will jump right over into cold, cold water for you </br>
And although time may take us into different places </br>
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know </br>
</li>

  <li>
  I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight </br>
I won't let go </br>
I'll be your lifeline tonight
</li> 

 <li>Cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?  </br>
It's how we learn and how we grow </br>
And I wanna lay with you 'til I'm old </br>
You shouldn't be fighting on your own
 
          </li>
<li>And if you feel you're sinking </br>
I will jump right over into cold, cold water for you </br>
And although time may take us into different places </br>
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know
          </li>
          <li>I won't let go (I won't let go, no, no, no, no, no, no) </br>
I'll be your lifeline tonight </br>
I won't let go </br>
I'll be your lifeline tonight
          </li>
          <li>
           [MØ:] </br>
Come on, come on </br>
Save me from my rocking boat </br>
I just want to stay afloat </br>
I'm all alone </br>
And I hope, I hope </br>
Someone is gonna take me home </br>
Somewhere I can rest my soul </br>
I need to know 
 
          </li>
<li>[Justin Bieber & MØ:] </br>
You won't let go (I won't let go, no, no, no, no, no, no) </br>
I'll be your lifeline tonight </br>
You won't let go </br>
I'll be your lifeline tonight </br>

[Justin Bieber:] </br>
I won't let go </br>
I won't let go   
          </li>
